🎬 Movie Recommendation System

The Movie Recommendation System is a simple JavaScript and reactjs project that suggests movies to users based on their interests.
It uses the logic such as genre matching, user input, or similar movie names to recommend movies.

This project demonstrates how basic programming and data handling can be used to create a recommendation feature without complex algorithms.
